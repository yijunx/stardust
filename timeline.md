Phase 1 (this might take several months)

propose and valid (check market), takes about 3 months
we shall do whatever we can to approach professors, whoever might be a potential customer, whoever can give us hints. and then let's put all the thoughts into an idea file. and we can have a iterative process to cross check ideas with different people.

think about how to do (like what platform)
This is about how does the service look like.
It is web service hosted on cloud (dont ask people to download anaconda or python)
All codes running on cloud
Data can be stored on cloud also (if the customer think that it is not feasible, can use that companies server as well)
Let's will start UI design (with the help of ideas) to create the first working example
Let this process be together with the propose and valid

action items: (updated on 9/28/2018)
  1. do research on company statistics to identify potential user group
  2. do market segmentation / classification 
  3. find out what customer really wants (where are the pains)
  4. modify our product_desc.md

Phase 2 (this might take several months also)

let's build it up and have the first working sample

phase 3

with the first working sample
another round of propose and valid and verification

phase 4
