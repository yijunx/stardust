# stardust

welcome to project stardust

let's create something in between (or include both of) an ERM and factory planning, let's help manufacturers of all kinds to better spend their money and better manage their factory (or any production facility, even a noodle stall)
Here on GitHub, this project is just for the initiation, for the ideas, for whatever thinking we should do before building up a full-fledged company. 
Another real one will be opened once we figured out how to do, and figure out what is the good method to do. 

How do we start?

start with our pull requests to know more about GitHub, by changing readme file or timeline, and key in your ideas. let's discuss and then merge in to the main and then execute to that.

On GitHub

let's try to get familiar with GitHub from your first pull request.

what about us

ALL of us are the owners of this project. Thus, please feel strongly that you want to do this, otherwise it will become a burden. Hopefully it is worthy of our time and we can help others with whatever knowledge we have. Also, all of us are like stem cells, each of us may evolve to take some sectors. Only some (or even) none of us will be code writers. However I do hope each of us can have the coding concept in mind, I think this is a very good way to exponentially boost the efficiency of such a small team.
