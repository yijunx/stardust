# stardust

welcome to project stardust

let's create something in between (or include both of) an ERM and factory planning, let's help manufacturers of all kinds to better spend their money and better manage their factory (or any production facility, even a noodle stall)

How do we start?

start with our pull requests to know more about GitHub, by changing readme file or timeline, and key in your ideas. let's discuss and then merge in to the main and then execute to that.

On GitHub

let's try to get familiar with GitHub from your first pull request...

what about us

ALL of us are the owners of this project. Thus, please feel strongly that you want to do this, otherwise it will become a burden. Hopefully it is worthy of our time and we can help others with whatever knowledge we have.
